# Moving-Companion

This "moving companion" utilizes APIs from Google Maps Streetview, the New York Times, and Wikipedia to bring the user a feel for any address in the USA that they might like to move to.

When the user inputs any address in the USA, we are given the Google Streetview Image, and any New York Times stories or Wikipedia entries that may be relevant for the particular address.
